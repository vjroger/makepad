///   ([`EnvSun::irradiance`]) is the key's whole emission, which a surface
///   facing a small light receives in full and a wide one in part (`facing`).
/// - `facing` is the share of that emission a surface facing the key's centre
///   receives, ∫ L cosθ dΩ / ∫ L dΩ over the key's reach (θ measured from
///   `dir`), in 0..=1. The sun and the moon, discs under a degree wide, have

///   presets the Overcast dome (a 110 degree disc) has about 0.78, the Top
///   softbox 0.93, the Rim pair 0.95, the Three-point and Ring lights 0.98.
///   The renderer multiplies its directional light's colour by it, so the
///   one light delivers what a surface facing the key receives from the map.
/// - `cos_cover` is the cosine of the half-angle of the smallest cone around
///   `dir` that holds the key's whole reach: a sun's or moon's outer limb
///   (soft edge included), a studio key's reach box with its corners and soft
///   edge, a detected sun's grown cone. It is at most `cos_radius` (the cone
///   `radiance` is averaged over lies inside it). The renderer takes the
///   cone out of the map's own lighting (SH9, specular) because the
///   directional light carries the key's energy, and takes all of it, so no
///   part of the key is lit twice.
///
/// What each producer puts in `radiance`:
/// - a generated sun: its irradiance at the ground spread over the nominal
///   disc's cone, the soft limb past it included;
/// - the moon: the mean over its disc;
/// - a studio key: the light integrated once per map over its own tangent
///   plane (shape, corner, ring, soft edge, hotspot, roll, and the Multiply
///   flags after it), so a thin strip or a ring carries only what it draws;
///   part of a wide rect's or a soft light's emission lies outside the cone
///   (up to about 8 % for the built-in studio presets) and is counted in it,
///   and `cos_cover` is what holds it;
/// - a detected sun (`hdri::detect_sun`): the energy it gathered over the
///   cone's solid angle.
///
/// `cos_radius` is an f32: for the 0.53 degree sun `1 − cos_radius` keeps
/// about three significant digits, and for a 0.1 degree sun about one. So
/// every producer divides the emission by the cone as an f32 `cos_radius`
