//! Stock PBR props under image-based lighting (phase 3 of the HDRI plan).
//!
//! A shiny placed model with no material of its own (none named, or one
//! that is not installed: `has_own_material`) draws on the PBR lane
//! (`ModelDraw::Pbr`) until a world names an environment. Then it draws
//! through `__stock_ibl`: an engine-owned Splash material program that is
//! the PBR lane with `Builtin::Ibl` installed (custom_material.rs) and
//! nothing else — no hooks, the stock shadow caster, nothing that cuts a
//! pixel (its opaque draws take the variant without `clip`, as the PBR
//! lane's do). `ModelDraw::Custom` walks the same instance loop as the PBR
//! lane, so the model keeps its textures (bound by name), its morph
//! targets and its generated skin surface; slot 5 receives the atlas as it
//! does for every IBL material (draw_models.rs).
//!
//! The program is built on first use, once, and stays installed until the
//! host drops its materials (`retain_custom_materials`, `enter_realm`): the
//! next frame under an environment builds it again, and a build that
//! failed is made again only then (`stock_ibl_forget_failure`). Whether
//! this frame routes through it is decided after the environment is
//! resolved (`prepare_stock_ibl`, in `draw_scene_scoped` after
//! `resolve_ibl_for`), from the IBL texture (the bound preparation's; a
//! fork's is the live renderer's, mirrored) and the shader on the
//! program's draw, and decided again in each model list's diffuse pass,
//! before any lane walks that list (`confirm_stock_ibl`, beside
//! `pbr_ready`): only there are this frame's features known, and the lanes
//! draw through the program's variant for them, a shader of its own, so the
//! models leave the PBR lane only once that variant's pipeline is ready.
//! Without an environment nothing is built and both lanes take exactly the
//! instances they took before.
//!
//! The lanes that take the IBL lookups (this program, the skin lane's
//! surface path, the IBL item materials and a host's IBL material) read
//! one control, `ibl_ctl`, resolved per draw where the frame makes its rig
//! (`resolve_ibl_lane`) and written when a lane binds (`ibl_lane_ctl`):
//! - y, the lane's scale on both lookups: 1 under HDR output, the map's own
//!   exposure in the legacy lane (`sun::env_lane_scale`, the factor the
//!   rig's fill is made with), so everything in a lane carries one
//!   exposure. The shared `mat_ibl_*` functions stay at the map's own scale:
//!   the dome applies its own exposure, a legacy fork draws the live HDR
//!   renderer's texture (the meta row cannot carry a lane's value), and a
//!   preview reads them as they are.
//! - z, the fill from the map. Cleared on the stock lanes (this program and
//!   the skin lane) while the world authors its fill (`SunConfig.ambient`,
//!   a `Light::Sky`: `sun::fill_is_authored`) or fast GI gathers one for
//!   the draw: they keep the fill they had before they took the lookups
//!   and take the reflection alone from the map. An item's or a host's IBL
//!   material has no such fill: it always fills from the map.
