//! Image-based lighting for Splash materials (KERNELS.md §3.3.3). Opt-in:
//! `World::environment.ibl` names an environment; the renderer prepares it
//! off the UI thread (hdri/prepare.rs: render-material's lane texture, a
//! full-resolution dome, and the numbers the sun rig, the exposure and the
//! fog take from the map) and binds the lane texture on the detail slot of
//! the materials compiled with IBL once it lands. Until then, and without
//! an environment, nothing is bound and every stock lane keeps its
//! analytic sky reflection. `Background::Environment` draws the dome as the
//! sky (`DrawEnvBackground`); once it is up the frame skips its analytic
//! dome.
//!
//! Preparations land at the renderer's pace (K1): one job at a time, and a
//! job runs to its end even when the world declares another key meanwhile
//! (a running clock re-declares its sun every quarter hour, or every
//! frame); its result is adopted when it lands, newer than what is bound,
//! and then the latest key prepares. So light and sky are at most one
//! preparation behind the world and always come from the same preparation.
//! Only a change of map cancels the job in flight (another `Arc` registered
//! under its handle, another environment named, an unregister): the job
//! polls a token between its stages and stops, and whatever it still
//! returns is rejected when it is taken.
//!
//! A fork of the renderer (a split-screen pane, the AI world review) draws
//! the live renderer's environment (I4): it mirrors the maps and the bound
//! preparation (`Renderer::mirror_environment_from`) and resolves nothing.
