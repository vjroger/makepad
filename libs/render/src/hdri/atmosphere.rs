//! Clear-sky atmosphere for the HDRI generator.
//!
//! Single scattering by air (Rayleigh) and haze (Mie, with the Cornette-Shanks
//! form of the Henyey-Greenstein phase), with ozone absorption, on a spherical
//! Earth. The marching scheme follows wwwtyro/glsl-atmosphere (Unlicense,
//! https://github.com/wwwtyro/glsl-atmosphere): march the view ray through the
//! shell and, at every sample, take the optical depth toward the sun. What an
//! environment map needs beyond that shader is added here: ozone, the Earth's
//! shadow (so twilight is right), a tabulated optical depth toward the sun in
//! place of the nested march, a small multiple-scattering term, a lit ground
//! below the horizon and an energy-preserving sun disc.
//!
//! A clear sky mirrors about the sun's vertical plane, so everything that
//! depends on the view is computed once into a sky-view table indexed by the
//! view elevation and the azimuth away from the sun; `sky()` is one bilinear
//! lookup.
//!
//! Units: lengths in metres, tabulated in f64 so planet-sized numbers keep
//! their precision; radiance in the scene units fixed by `SUN_IRRADIANCE`.
//! Directions are in the map's own frame (before the map rotation): y up,
//! x east, -z north, the frame `ibl::dir_to_equirect_uv` maps.
//!
//! ## Radiance scale
//!
//! Everything is linear Rec.709 radiance in the units `SUN_IRRADIANCE` sets.
//! With 20.0 per channel at the top of the atmosphere, a high sun delivers a
//! ground irradiance of about 17.6 in luminance ((18.8, 17.4, 15.4) rgb), so
//! a white wall facing it reads E / pi = 5.6 plus a few tenths from the sky,
//! a clear zenith sits at a few tenths and the 0.53 deg disc at about 3e5.
//! Against the engine, per the spec's Conventions:
//!
//! - `ibl::EnvPreset` (render_material/src/ibl.rs:285-381) paints surfaces at
//!   0.1-1, softboxes at 2-9 and `Sunset`'s 0.6 deg disc at 300, which carries
//!   only ~0.1 of irradiance: those are looks, not a photometric scale. The
//!   generator keeps the sun-to-sky ratio real (a thousand times the preset's
//!   disc) so `ibl::prefilter` and `ibl::sh9` see a key light that agrees with
//!   `Env::sun`.
//! - The renderer's HDR lane (`SunLight::to_hdr`, sun.rs:103-117): the direct
//!   term is 0.72 x 3.0 = 2.16 and the shaders apply it as `color * N.L` with
//!   no 1/pi, so "a noon white wall sits near 2.0 before exposure"; the day
//!   fill is 0.28 x 0.8 = 0.22 per hemisphere; the analytic dome is drawn at
//!   its Preetham luminance x `HDR_SKY_GAIN` = 0.4 (renderer/frame.rs:9), and
//!   `SunLight::hdr_exposure` meters 0.75 over the rig's key, clamped to
//!   0.25..3.2.
//!
//! The generator's outdoor scale is therefore about 3x the engine's HDR lane
//! (a noon wall of 6 against 2). Nothing here rescales: `Ibl.intensity`
//! (0.35 reproduces the stock brightness) or phase 2's environment-metered
//! exposure absorbs the factor, and `tests::the_documented_scale_holds` pins
//! these numbers so this note cannot rot.
