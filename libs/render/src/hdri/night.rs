//! Night layers of the Sky mode: stars, the moon and the night glow.
//!
//! **Brightness.** Everything is scaled against the atmosphere's `SUN_IRRADIANCE`,
//! so the ratios inside the night are physical:
//! - a full moon is about 1/400000 of the sun, and its disc about as bright as a
//!   daytime sky;
//! - a dark moonless sky (glow_strength 1) is about 22 mag/arcsec²;
//! - a star's irradiance follows its magnitude.
//!
//! On top of that the night is *adapted*. As the sun sinks from the horizon to
//! −12°, the night layers are exposed up by NIGHT_ADAPTATION_EV, the way eyes and
//! night photographs adapt. Three things follow:
//! - the daytime moon stays physical, faint against a blue sky;
//! - twilight hands over to night without a jump;
//! - a night map exports at levels a renderer can use.
//!
//! **Stars** sit on the celestial sphere and wheel with the solar hour around the
//! pole for the latitude (`crate::sun::celestial_rows`). They hang on the 3D grid
//! of the sky shader (`shaders/sky_dome.rs:171-193`), evaluated on the CPU:
//! - space is cut into cubes; each cube hashes one jittered point and holds a
//!   star where that point, normalised, meets the unit sphere. A cube lattice cut
//!   by the sphere gives a uniform field with no pinch at the poles;
//! - a star is a Gaussian of the perpendicular distance to it, of a fixed angular
//!   size: a sharp core plus a halo, so it neither aliases away at 512×256 nor
//!   lands on a single pixel at 8K;
//! - brightness follows a magnitude-like distribution, colour a hashed
//!   temperature, and the field is thicker along the Milky Way.
//!
//! **Moon.** A sphere lit from the sun's direction, so its phase follows the
//! sun-moon geometry.
//! - The terminator is where the surface turns away from the sun (n·sun = 0).
//! - The lit side is shaded Lommel-Seeliger. The regolith scatters like dust, so
//!   a full moon is flat bright out to the limb instead of darkening like a
//!   Lambert ball.
//! - Earthshine lights the dark side faintly, strongest near new moon.
//! - Its light also scatters in the air, as a blue Rayleigh sky plus a Mie
//!   aureole. That is what turns a moonlit sky blue.
//!
//! **Glow** is airglow: a thin emitting layer about 100 km up. It therefore
//! brightens toward the horizon by the van Rhijn factor (5.7× at the horizon).
