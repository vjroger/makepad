//! Procedural HDRI generator: outdoor skies (sun, atmosphere, clouds, moon,
//! stars) and studio lighting (a backdrop plus shaped lights) as linear
//! Rec.709 HDR equirect maps, in the engine's own [`EnvMap`].
//!
//! [`Env::new`] does all the work that depends only on the parameters, and
//! [`Env::radiance`] then answers "what arrives from this direction" for
//! any direction. The app preview, file export and the engine's dome all
//! sample that one function, so they cannot disagree.
//!
//! Conventions (pinned by the tests at the bottom of this file):
//! - Y is up, +X is east and -Z is north.
//! - Azimuths are degrees clockwise from north (0 = -Z, 90 = +X), as in NOAA
//!   and `ibl::dir_deg`.
//! - Equirect: `ibl`'s, and only `ibl`'s: `u = 0.5 + atan2(x, -z) / 2pi`,
//!   `v = acos(y) / pi`. -Z (north) sits at the image centre, +X at
//!   u = 0.75, row 0 is the zenith and texels are evaluated at their
//!   centres. `EnvMap::from_fn`, `prefilter`, `sh9`, `DrawEnvBackground`
//!   and the `mat_ibl_*` shader functions all assume this, so a baked map
//!   plugs into every one of them unchanged. Files keep the DCC convention
//!   (+X at the centre); `image::roll_quarter` converts at the file
//!   boundary and nowhere else.
//! - `rotation_deg` turns the content about +Y, positive counter-clockwise
//!   seen from above, exactly as `EnvMap::procedural` and `Ibl.rotation_deg`
//!   do: +90 moves a light at -Z to -X ([`rotate_y`]).
//! - `ibl` works in `[f32; 3]`; this module works in `Vec3f` and converts at
//!   the boundary with [`arr`] and [`vec`].
//!
//! Design: local/agent_state/hdri/design.md (local notes, not under version
//! control).

// `!(x > 0.0)` and its kin are written negated on purpose throughout this module and its
// children: a NaN fails the comparison, so it takes the guard's branch. Clippy would have
// them as `partial_cmp`, which says the same in more words.
