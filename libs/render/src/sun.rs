//! The one game light (shiny.md T7, game side).
//!
//! `draw::SceneSun` is the repo's single lighting model, but it speaks map
//! space (x east, y SOUTH, z up) while games are y-up. [`SunLight`] is that
//! same model expressed in game space, and it is the ONLY place the game
//! shaders get their light from — before this, cube/terrain/skinned each
//! carried their own hardcoded ambient/direct split and the sun direction
//! was a per-instance value set in five different script blocks.
//!
//! Axis mapping (map -> game): `x` stays east, map `z` (up) becomes game
//! `y`, map `y` (south) becomes game `z`. So a map dir `(x, y, z)` is a
//! game dir `(x, z, y)`.
